# KG Validation Report

## Ethics_KG.json

- **Agent Definitions:** Contains two agents: 
  - *BaseLanguageGameAgent*: Uses the `agent_code` property with a Groovy script to capture contextual language games.
  - *AristotelianEthicsAgent*: Uses the `agent_code` property with a Groovy script implementing Aristotelian ethical logic.

- **Type of Agent:** Both agents use Groovy code, not LLM-based logic (`llmLogic`).

- **Implication:** These agents are designed to be executed as Groovy scripts, ensuring that the dynamic prompts are provided via the KG JSON file rather than through hard-coded ARC puzzle prompts. 

## Internal_KG.json

- **Agent Definitions:** There are no agent definitions in Internal_KG.json. 

- **Purpose:** This file is focused on internal configuration (e.g., ethics approval scripts, user definitions, policies) and does not define agents for dynamic generation.

## Conclusion

- The Ethics KG agents are correctly defined to use Groovy (via `agent_code`), and no language agents (using `llmLogic`) are present.
- The issue of hard-coded ARC puzzle prompts does not apply here.
- Overall, the KG definitions for agent generation in the Ethics and Internal KGs are valid with respect to their intended behavior.
