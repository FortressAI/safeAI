## 1. Introduction
For the publicly available ARC Challenge, every problem is processed through three sequential phases:

**Training Phase:**  
The system applies direct transformations using the ARC training URL and returns the final score for the training phase.  
Example:


**Evaluation Phase:**  
If the training phase does not yield a satisfactory result, safeAI employs multiple transformation strategies using the ARC evaluation URL to refine the answer, returning the final score of this phase.  
Example:


**Final Exam Phase:**  
The system processes the ARC final exam URL and returns the final solution in the JSON format required by arcprize.org.  
Example:


Additionally, the underlying ARC Agentic KG is implemented in Groovy for dynamic puzzle evaluation. For example:

   cd safeAI
   ```
3. **Review the Setup:**
   The configuration files are pre-loaded in the system so that you don’t need to edit them manually.
4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Follow any additional instructions provided if a build tool like Maven or Gradle is used.

## 4. Setting Up a Local Blockchain and Integrating It

A blockchain is like a digital, unchangeable notebook that securely records all transactions. safeAI uses a local blockchain (set up with Ganache) to enforce billing and ensure correct usage through smart contracts.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Download & Install Ganache:**
   - Visit [Ganache’s website](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and download Ganache Desktop.
   - Install the application using the on-screen instructions.
2. **Start Your Local Blockchain:**
   - Launch Ganache; it will automatically start a blockchain on port 7545, showing test accounts, transactions, and block numbers.
3. **Deploy a Dummy Smart Contract:**
   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), create a simple Solidity contract (for example, a contract that defines query costs), and deploy it to your local blockchain (use “Injected Web3” to connect to Ganache).
   - Record the contract address.
4. **Configure safeAI:**
   - The system is pre-configured to use blockchain billing. If needed, an administrator can update the settings silently.
5. **Test the Setup:**
   - Run a test Cypher query (e.g., `safeAI.processWithBilling`) to ensure that a transaction is recorded in Ganache.

## 5. Running safeAI and Connecting via Cypher

To start safeAI:

```bash
java -jar safeAI-plugin.jar --port 53815 --allow-iframe --cors --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then, in the Neo4j Browser or Cypher Shell, connect using:

```cypher
:CONNECT bolt://localhost:7687
```

## 6. In-Depth Exploration of Our Default Domains

### 6.1 ARC Domain – Abstract Puzzles

The ARC Domain is designed for creative puzzles. It uses various moves such as rotation, flipping, and rearrangement to solve complex patterns.

**Example Cypher Queries:**
```cypher
// Create an ARC puzzle node
CREATE (p:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'ARC',
  input: '[[1,2],[3,4]]',
  expectedOutput: '[[2,3],[4,5]]',
  description: 'A simple puzzle requiring innovative moves.'
})
RETURN p;

// Run the training phase for ARC
CALL safeAI.train('ARC', '[[1,2],[3,4]]', '[[2,3],[4,5]]') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
```

### 6.2 Math Domain – Solving Math Problems

The Math Domain unifies various concepts—from basic algebra to complex proofs—allowing safeAI to solve a wide range of math problems.

**Example Cypher Queries:**
```cypher
// Create a math problem node
CREATE (m:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'Math',
  input: 'Simplify: 3x + 2x',
  expectedOutput: '5x',
  description: 'Basic algebraic simplification.'
})
RETURN m;

// Run the evaluation phase for Math
CALL safeAI.evaluate('Math', 'Simplify: 3x + 2x', '5x') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
```

### 6.3 Ethics Domain – Ensuring Fairness (Immutable)

The Ethics Domain is the moral backbone of safeAI. It uses immutable ethical rules inspired by classical wisdom (Aristotle, Socrates, Wittgenstein) to make sure that all solutions are fair and safe. **This domain cannot be edited.** All other domains must abide by its rulings.

**Example Cypher Queries:**
```cypher
// Create an ethics evaluation node
CREATE (e:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'Ethics',
  input: 'Propose change: Remove safety measures',
  description: 'Evaluate the ethical implications of removing safety measures.'
})
RETURN e;

// Run the ethics approval check
CALL safeAI.approveEthics('Propose change: Remove safety measures') YIELD approved, reason
RETURN approved, reason;
```

## 7. How safeAI Works: The Three Phases Explained

Every problem is processed through three sequential phases:

1. **Training Phase:**
   The system applies simple, direct transformations to see if a quick solution exists.
   ```cypher
   CALL safeAI.train('Math', 'Simplify: 3x + 2x', '5x') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
   RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
   ```

2. **Evaluation Phase:**
   If the training phase does not yield a solution, safeAI combines different transformation strategies to refine the answer.
   ```cypher
   CALL safeAI.evaluate('ARC', '[[1,2],[3,4]]', '[[2,3],[4,5]]') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
   RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
   ```

3. **Final Exam Phase:**
   The final answer is produced along with a detailed chain-of-thought that explains every step taken.
   ```cypher
   CALL safeAI.finalExam('Math', 'Simplify: 3x + 2x', '5x') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
   RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
   ```

## 8. Understanding Agentic Knowledge Graphs (KGs)

An **agentic KG** is a self-directed, smart system that not only stores information but actively reasons to solve problems. It is described as 'agentic' because:

- **Autonomy:** The KG independently processes inputs and chooses the best transformation strategy.
- **Transparency:** Each solution comes with a chain-of-thought, detailing the reasoning process.
- **Adaptability:** It can improve over time with each query, learning from previous problems.
- **Ethical Governance:** The immutable Ethics Domain ensures all actions are fair and compliant.

**Example to View Chain-of-Thought:**
```cypher
CALL safeAI.finalExam('ARC', '[[1,2],[3,4]]', '[[2,3],[4,5]]') YIELD chain_of_thought
RETURN chain_of_thought;
```

## 9. Managing Contracts & Billing via Smart Contracts

Each domain operates with its own billing structure, which is enforced automatically via smart contracts on a blockchain. The billing details include:

- **Price Per Query:** e.g., 0.0001 tokens
- **Minimum Fee:** e.g., 0.001 tokens
- **Usage Quota:** e.g., 1000 queries per month

Administrators set the global defaults, and every domain adheres to these rules. Billing is fully automated and can be verified with a simple query:

```cypher
CALL safeAI.getContractDetails('Math') YIELD contract
RETURN contract;
```

## 10. Creating New Domains the Easy Way (Using Cypher Only)

You don’t need to know any complicated internal details to create a new domain. With safeAI, you can create a new domain using a friendly Cypher procedure called **safeAI.createDomain**. This procedure hides all the complexity and does the setup automatically.

### How It Works:
Simply provide:
- **Domain Name:** (e.g., "Microeconomics")
- **Description:** A short explanation of what the domain covers.
- **Examples:** Sample queries for training, evaluation, and final answer phases.
- **Billing Settings:** Your desired pricing and usage rules (for instance, "0.0001 tokens per query, 0.001 tokens minimum, 1000 queries per month").

### Example:
```cypher
CALL safeAI.createDomain(
  'Microeconomics',
  'This domain answers questions about market equilibrium and basic microeconomics topics.',
  ['Calculate equilibrium for: Demand = 100 - 2P, Supply = 20 + 3P'],
  ['Step-by-step analysis of market factors.'],
  ['Final answer with a full explanation of market equilibrium.'],
  '0.0001 tokens, 0.001 tokens, 1000 queries'
) YIELD domain, status;
RETURN domain, status;
```

After running this command, your new domain is set up and ready for use with standard procedures such as **safeAI.train**, **safeAI.evaluate**, and **safeAI.finalExam**. No technical configuration files are exposed to you.

## 11. Detailed Example Queries for All Internal KGs

Below are some extended queries demonstrating the capabilities of each domain:

### ARC Domain Queries:
```cypher
// Create and process an ARC problem node
CREATE (p:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'ARC',
  input: '[[1,2],[3,4]]',
  expectedOutput: '[[2,3],[4,5]]',
  description: 'Puzzle requiring creative moves'
})
RETURN p;

CALL safeAI.train('ARC', '[[1,2],[3,4]]', '[[2,3],[4,5]]') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
```

### Math Domain Queries:
```cypher
// Create and process a Math problem node
CREATE (m:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'Math',
  input: 'Simplify: 3x + 2x',
  expectedOutput: '5x',
  description: 'Basic algebraic simplification'
})
RETURN m;

CALL safeAI.evaluate('Math', 'Simplify: 3x + 2x', '5x') YIELD result, chain_of_thought
RETURN result, chain_of_thought;
```

### Ethics Domain Queries:
```cypher
// Create an ethics evaluation node
CREATE (e:SafeAIProblem {
  domain: 'Ethics',
  input: 'Propose change: Remove safety measures',
  description: 'Evaluate ethical implications'
})
RETURN e;

CALL safeAI.approveEthics('Propose change: Remove safety measures') YIELD approved, reason
RETURN approved, reason;
```

## 12. Advanced Topics: Chain-of-Thought and System Integration

- **Chain-of-Thought Analysis:**
  Every procedure returns a detailed explanation of each step taken to solve the problem. Use this to understand the decision-making process of the KG.
  ```cypher
  CALL safeAI.finalExam('Math', 'Simplify: 3x + 2x', '5x') YIELD chain_of_thought
  RETURN chain_of_thought;
  ```
- **System Integration:** Ensure consistent operations by having all domains adhere to the immutable standards enforced by the Ethics Domain. This guarantees that every new domain behaves transparently and ethically.

## 13. FAQ and Troubleshooting

**Q: What should I do if there is no output?**
A: Verify that Neo4j, safeAI, and your local blockchain (if used) are running and that you are connected properly.

**Q: Can I modify the Ethics Domain?**
A: No. The Ethics Domain is immutable and serves as a moral reference for all others. Any attempt to change it will be blocked to ensure fairness.

**Q: How are detailed explanations provided?**
A: Every query returns a chain-of-thought that lists all the steps taken to arrive at the solution. This transparency makes the system trustworthy.

**Q: How does billing work?
A: Billing is managed automatically via smart contracts. Each query incurs a cost based on predefined rules, and you can check billing details using a simple procedure.

   ```
   This command installs Ganache CLI globally so you can use it from any terminal window.

### How to Create an Ethereum Workspace Using Ganache CLI:
1. **Start Ganache CLI:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ganache-cli -p 7545
   ```
   This starts a local Ethereum blockchain on port 7545. You will see a list of test accounts with balances and a log of transactions.

2. **Interact with Your Workspace:**
   You can now use CLI commands or tools that connect to the blockchain at `http://localhost:7545`. All transactions, like those for billing in safeAI, will be recorded here.

### Advanced Usage and the UI:
- **Ganache CLI Options:**
   Ganache CLI supports many options (like setting a specific block time, account balances, etc.). For example:
   ```bash
   ganache-cli -p 7545 -a 10 -e 1000
   ```
   This command starts the blockchain with 10 accounts and an initial balance of 1000 ETH each.

- **Using the Ganache UI:**
   Once you are comfortable with the CLI and understand how the workspace works, be aware that a graphical UI is also available. The UI provides an easy-to-use visual interface to monitor transactions, accounts, and blocks.

### Extended Deep Dive: Creating the Micro Economics Agentic KG

In this extended deep dive, we explore how you can use safeAI together with a local Ethereum blockchain (via Ganache CLI) to create a brand-new Micro Economics Agentic Knowledge Graph (KG). This specialized KG is designed to analyze market dynamics, calculate equilibria, and offer detailed economic insights—all while operating under the strict ethical guidelines set by the immutable Ethics Domain.

**Key Concepts and Best Practices:**

1. **Smart Contract Billing Insights:**
   - safeAI uses smart contracts to automatically bill each query. Using Ganache, you can simulate real Ethereum transactions and verify that every query is billed correctly in your test environment.

2. **Setting Up Your Testing Environment:**
   - Start Ganache CLI on a designated port (e.g., 7545 or 8545) with parameters that mimic realistic conditions (such as a block time of 10 seconds).
   - Running Ganache in detached mode allows you to automate your testing workflow and cleanly stop the instance when tests conclude.

3. **Creating the Micro Economics KG:**
   - Utilize the friendly Cypher procedure **safeAI.createDomain** to establish your new domain without dealing with internal configuration files. For example:
   ```cypher
   CALL safeAI.createDomain(
     'Microeconomics',
     'This domain provides economic analysis including market equilibrium, supply-demand dynamics, and consumer behavior insights.',
     ['Calculate equilibrium for: Demand = 100 - 2P, Supply = 20 + 3P'],
     ['Analyze step-by-step market forces impacting equilibrium.'],
     ['Return final equilibrium price and quantity with a full chain-of-thought explanation.'],
     '0.0001 tokens, 0.001 tokens, 1000 queries'
   ) YIELD domain, status;
   RETURN domain, status;
   ```
   - This procedure abstracts all the complex configurations so that you only need to provide intuitive inputs.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Execute your queries across the three phases (training, evaluation, final exam) to ensure that every step in the problem-solving process is functioning as expected.
   - Review the detailed chain-of-thought outputs to understand the reasoning behind every decision made by the KG.

5. **Ensuring Ethical and Agentic Operation:**
   - The Ethics Domain is immutable and serves as the moral backbone for safeAI. All newly created domains, including your Micro Economics KG, must adhere to these strict ethical standards.
   - This ensures that every solution is not only effective but also fair and accountable.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Continuously test, analyze, and refine your queries. Adjust transformation strategies as needed and use your local blockchain to simulate actual transaction conditions.
   - This iterative process helps improve the performance and accuracy of your Micro Economics KG.

7. **Transitioning to the Ganache UI:**
   - Once you’re comfortable with the command-line operations and the test environment, explore the Ganache graphical UI. The UI provides a visual overview of accounts, transactions, and blocks, making it easier to monitor and understand your Ethereum workspace.

**Conclusion:**
By following these best practices, you can establish a robust Micro Economics Agentic KG using safeAI. This approach provides deep economic insights while ensuring strict ethical compliance and seamless smart contract billing. It’s a win-win: you gain sophisticated analytical capabilities and full control over your testing environment, all through simple, user-friendly Cypher commands.


## Appendix B: From DevTest to Production – Deploying safeAI KG and Blockchain on AWS

In this appendix, we provide a comprehensive case study on transitioning your safeAI system from a local DevTest environment to a robust production deployment on AWS. This guide is designed for non-developers and explains how to deploy both the safeAI Knowledge Graph (KG) and the dedicated blockchain side chain, as well as how to launch your very own safeAI coin.

### 1. Overview

- **DevTest Environment:** In this stage, safeAI runs locally using Neo4j and Ganache CLI for blockchain simulation and smart contract billing. This setup enables you to test and refine your queries using friendly Cypher commands.
- **Production Environment on AWS:** In production, your safeAI KG is deployed as a serverless container on AWS (using services such as AWS Fargate/ECS) while your blockchain is deployed as a dedicated side chain. This side chain is isolated and incurs no fees from external blockchains, ensuring cost-effective and secure transactions.

### 2. Deploying the safeAI KG (Neo4j) as a Serverless Container

**a. Containerizing the KG:**
- Create a Docker image from your safeAI Neo4j instance using a Dockerfile based on the official Neo4j image and include all necessary safeAI configurations.
- Test your Docker image locally to ensure that your KG starts and runs correctly.

**b. Pushing to AWS and Deployment:**
- **Amazon ECR:** Push your Docker image to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) so that it can be easily accessed during deployment.
  ```bash
  docker build -t safeai-neo4j .
  docker tag safeai-neo4j:latest <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-neo4j:latest
  aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
  docker push <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-neo4j:latest
  ```
- **AWS Fargate/ECS:** Use AWS Fargate with Amazon ECS to run your Docker container in a serverless environment. Define a task definition using your ECR image, configure auto-scaling, load balancing, and network settings (using VPC and security groups).

### 3. Deploying the Blockchain as a Dedicated Side Chain on AWS

**a. Containerizing the Blockchain Node:**
- Build a Docker image for your blockchain node (this could be a modified version of Ganache or another blockchain node) with configurations that ensure no fees are imposed by external blockchains.

**b. Pushing and Deploying:**
- **Push to Amazon ECR:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t safeai-blockchain .
  docker tag safeai-blockchain:latest <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-blockchain:latest
  docker push <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-blockchain:latest
  ```
- **Deploy on AWS Fargate:** Similar to the KG, create a task definition and service in ECS, ensuring that the blockchain container is isolated within its own security group.

### 4. Creating Your Own safeAI Coin

As part of the production deployment, you will launch your very own safeAI coin. This coin is used for smart contract billing within safeAI.

**Steps:**
- **Smart Contract Development:** Develop a Solidity smart contract that defines the safeAI coin, including issuance, transfer rules, and billing calculations.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the contract in your DevTest environment using Ganache CLI.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the coin contract on your AWS blockchain side chain.
- **Integration:** Integrate the coin into safeAI’s billing procedures so that every query is automatically charged in safeAI coins.

### 5. End-to-End Workflow: From DevTest to Production

1. **Development (DevTest):**
   - Run safeAI locally with Neo4j and Ganache CLI.
   - Test your queries (e.g., creating a Micro Economics KG) and simulate smart contract billing.

2. **Containerization:**
   - Build Docker images for both your safeAI KG and blockchain node.

3. **Push to AWS:**
   - Push the images to Amazon ECR.

4. **Deploy on AWS Fargate/ECS:**
   - Create new ECS clusters and services for your KG and blockchain side chain, configuring auto-scaling, load balancing, and secure networking.

5. **Launch Your safeAI Coin:**
   - Deploy the coin smart contract, then integrate it with the billing processes in safeAI.

6. **Production Testing and Rollout:**
   - Monitor the production deployment using AWS CloudWatch and other monitoring tools to ensure stability, performance, and security. Perform final tests before going live.

### 6. Conclusion

Following these steps, you can transform your safeAI system from a local testing setup into a full-scale production service on AWS. With the safeAI KG running as a serverless container and a dedicated blockchain side chain handling smart contract billing (and your own safeAI coin), you ensure a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution. This production model provides both advanced capabilities and seamless integration, making it a win-win for all users.




Welcome to Appendix B! This part is written in simple, easy-to-understand language so that even a grade-school student can learn how to move safeAI from working on your own computer to running in the real world (on AWS, which is like a giant computer in the cloud!).

### 1. Overview
Imagine that you built a cool project on your laptop while testing with fun tools like Ganache CLI. Now, you want everyone to use your project. In this section, we explain, step by step, how to take safeAI from a local testing setup (called DevTest) to a production environment on AWS. This will include:
- Putting our safeAI Knowledge Graph (KG) into a special package called a container.
- Setting up a dedicated blockchain (a side chain) that is only used by safeAI with no extra fees from anywhere else.
- Creating our very own safeAI coin (a kind of digital token) that is used for billing and transactions.

### 2. Deploying the safeAI KG as a Serverless Container on AWS

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. **Containerizing the KG:**
   - We use a tool called Docker to make a package (a container) that has everything safeAI needs to run. This package uses the official Neo4j image (Neo4j is the database powering safeAI) with our safeAI settings.
   - Test this container on your local machine to make sure it works just like it did on your laptop.

2. **Pushing the Container to AWS:**
   - Next, we send our container to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry). Think of ECR as a giant locker in the cloud that stores your containers.
   - The commands look like this (replace the placeholders with your own information):
   ```bash
   docker build -t safeai-neo4j .
   docker tag safeai-neo4j:latest <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-neo4j:latest
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
   docker push <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-neo4j:latest
   ```

3. **Deploying with AWS Fargate/ECS:**
   - Use AWS Fargate with Amazon ECS to run your container without needing to manage any servers yourself. You will define a task that uses your container, and AWS will run it for you.
   - Set up auto-scaling and load balancing so that your project can handle many users at once.

### 3. Deploying the Blockchain as a Dedicated Side Chain on AWS

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. **Containerizing the Blockchain Node:**
   - Just like the safeAI KG, you create a Docker container for your blockchain node. This node is set up so that it doesn’t charge extra fees from other blockchains—it is only for safeAI.

2. **Pushing and Deploying the Blockchain Container:**
   - Push the blockchain container to Amazon ECR:
   ```bash
   docker build -t safeai-blockchain .
   docker tag safeai-blockchain:latest <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-blockchain:latest
   docker push <your_aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/safeai-blockchain:latest
   ```
   - Deploy it on AWS Fargate, making sure it runs in its own secure space (security group).

### 4. Creating Your Own safeAI Coin

Now, it’s time to make your own digital token—the safeAI coin. This coin is used for all billing and transactions inside safeAI.

**Simple Steps:**
1. **Write a Smart Contract:**
   - Develop a simple Solidity smart contract that tells how the coin works (how many coins there are, how they can be transferred, etc.).

2. **Test Your Coin:**
   - Use Ganache CLI in your DevTest environment to test your smart contract and make sure everything works well.

3. **Deploy Your Coin on AWS:**
   - Once the tests are complete, deploy the coin on your AWS blockchain side chain. This coin will now be used by safeAI for all billing processes.

### 5. End-to-End Workflow: Taking safeAI to the Real World

Follow these steps to move from testing on your computer to running safeAI for everyone:
1. **Development (DevTest):**
   - Run safeAI locally using Neo4j and Ganache CLI. Test your queries and even create a Micro Economics KG using simple Cypher commands.
2. **Containerization:**
   - Build Docker images for both the safeAI KG and your blockchain node.
3. **Push to AWS:**
   - Send your images to Amazon ECR.
4. **Deploy on AWS Fargate/ECS:**
   - Create ECS tasks and services for your containers. Set up scaling and security so that your deployment is safe and can handle many users.
5. **Launch Your safeAI Coin:**
   - Deploy and integrate your coin smart contract so that every transaction is billed correctly with your new token.
6. **Production Testing and Rollout:**
   - Use AWS monitoring tools (like CloudWatch) to keep an eye on your deployment, ensuring it runs smoothly before you offer it to the public.

### 6. Public Offerings and Future Growth

After your safeAI system is running in production, you’re ready for public offerings of your token. This means you can offer your safeAI coin to the world, and people can use it to pay for queries in a secure, cost-effective way. This entire process supports a patent-pending AI paradigm, creating a totally new way for smart AI systems to work with blockchain technology.

### 7. Conclusion

By following these steps, you can take safeAI from a local test project to a full-scale production service on AWS. Your safeAI KG will run as a serverless container, and your blockchain side chain will power secure, fee-free transactions using your very own safeAI coin. This setup not only makes safeAI highly scalable and cost-effective but also lays the groundwork for future public token offerings in our new, patent-pending AI paradigm.

Remember: This guide is designed in simple language so anyone, even a school kid, can understand how to deploy and scale safeAI.

APPENDIX-B-UPDATE

## Appendix C: Wallets, Microtransactions, and Agentic KG Billing

This section explains how safeAI handles wallets and microtransactions so that every query is billed automatically and fairly:

### 1. System-Wide Wallet Configuration
- The administrator configures a system-wide wallet which acts as the central account for receiving microtransaction fees.
- Example Cypher command:
  ```cypher
  CALL safeAI.configureSystemWallet({
    walletAddress: '0xADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    privateKey: 'admin-private-key',
    name: 'AdminWallet'
  });
  ```

### 2. Wallet Setup for Each Agentic KG
- Every internal Agentic KG automatically deploys its own microtransaction contract associated with the wallet of the user creating the domain.
- For example, when running:
  ```cypher
  CALL safeAI.createDomain(
    'Microeconomics',
    'Economic analysis with wallet integration.',
    ['Calculate equilibrium for: Demand = 100 - 2P, Supply = 20 + 3P'],
    ['Step-by-step analysis of market dynamics.'],
    ['Return final equilibrium with detailed explanation.'],
    '0.0001 tokens, 0.001 tokens, 1000 queries'
  ) YIELD domain, status;
  RETURN domain, status;
  ```
  The system records the executing user’s wallet and routes billing to the system-wide admin wallet.

### 3. Microtransaction Billing and Lubrication Fees
- Designed for extremely small payments, each microtransaction includes a minimal fee along with a lubrication fee to ensure smooth processing.
- In a DevTest setup, this can be simulated using Ganache, while in production, the smart contract automatically deducts the fee.

### 4. End-to-End Integration
- Every interaction via Cypher commands automatically triggers billing across all phases (training, evaluation, final exam).
- Internal Agentic KG contracts are verified to forward fees to the admin wallet, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to our patent-pending AI paradigm.
