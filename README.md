# safeAI Plugin: The Ultimate Extended Guide

Welcome to the ultimate extended guide for the safeAI Plugin! This guide is designed for beginners, school-age kids, and anyone who isn’t a developer. Our goal is to teach you everything about safeAI—from installing the plugin and setting up a local blockchain to using its built-in domains (ARC, Math, Ethics) and creating new domains via simple Cypher procedures. We hide all the complex details behind user-friendly commands so that you only interact with safeAI through simple Cypher queries.

This guide is much longer than usual so you can get an in-depth understanding of the whole system. Read through each section to discover what it means to work with an agentic Knowledge Graph (KG) and how safeAI ensures ethical, transparent problem-solving.

## 1. Introduction

Imagine having a super-smart helper that can solve puzzles, answer math questions, and even ensure that every solution is fair. That is what safeAI does. This guide will take you on a journey from the very basics—installing safeAI—to the advanced concepts of agentic Knowledge Graphs (KGs). No technical jargon, just simple, friendly Cypher commands that work like magic.

## 2. What is safeAI?

safeAI turns your Neo4j database into a powerful, interactive assistant using Agentic Knowledge Graphs. An agentic KG is like a mini intelligent brain: it observes, thinks, and then explains its solution step-by-step. safeAI comes with several pre-built domains:

- **ARC Domain:** Specializes in solving abstract puzzles with creative moves.
- **Math Domain:** Handles a variety of math problems using unified techniques.
- **Ethics Domain:** Ensures that every solution is ethical by enforcing immutable moral rules. (Note: This domain cannot be edited, and all other domains operate in accordance with its ethical standards.)

## Appendix B: From DevTest to Production – Deploying safeAI KG and Blockchain on AWS

In this appendix, we provide a comprehensive guide on transitioning your safeAI system from a DevTest environment to a full-scale production deployment on AWS.

### 1. Overview

- **DevTest Environment:** safeAI runs locally using Neo4j and Ganache CLI for blockchain simulation and smart contract billing.
- **Production Environment on AWS:** Your safeAI KG is deployed as a serverless container on AWS while your blockchain runs as a dedicated side chain, ensuring cost-effective and secure transactions.

### 2. Steps to Transition

1. **Containerize your safeAI KG:**
   - Create a Docker image based on the official Neo4j image with your safeAI configurations.
2. **Push to AWS ECR:**
   - Push your Docker image to Amazon ECR.
3. **Deploy on AWS Fargate/ECS:**
   - Use AWS Fargate with ECS for running your container in a serverless environment.
4. **Deploy the Blockchain Side Chain:**
   - Containerize and deploy your blockchain node as a dedicated side chain on AWS.
5. **Launch Your safeAI Coin:**
   - Deploy your smart contract for the safeAI coin for billing and microtransaction processes.

## Appendix C: Wallets, Microtransactions, and Agentic KG Billing

This section explains how safeAI handles wallets and microtransactions so that every query is billed automatically and fairly:

### 1. System-Wide Wallet Configuration
- The administrator configures a system-wide wallet which acts as the central account for receiving microtransaction fees.
- Example Cypher command:
  ```cypher
  CALL safeAI.configureSystemWallet({
    walletAddress: '0xADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    privateKey: 'admin-private-key',
    name: 'AdminWallet'
  });
  ```

### 2. Wallet Setup for Each Agentic KG
- Every internal Agentic KG automatically deploys its own microtransaction contract associated with the wallet of the user creating the domain.
- For example, when running:
  ```cypher
  CALL safeAI.createDomain(
    'Microeconomics',
    'Economic analysis with wallet integration.',
    ['Calculate equilibrium for: Demand = 100 - 2P, Supply = 20 + 3P'],
    ['Step-by-step analysis of market dynamics.'],
    ['Return final equilibrium with detailed explanation.'],
    '0.0001 tokens, 0.001 tokens, 1000 queries'
  ) YIELD domain, status;
  RETURN domain, status;
  ```
  The system records the executing user’s wallet and routes billing to the system-wide admin wallet.

### 3. Microtransaction Billing and Lubrication Fees
- Designed for extremely small payments, each microtransaction includes a minimal fee along with a lubrication fee to ensure smooth processing.
- In a DevTest setup, this can be simulated using Ganache, while in production, the smart contract automatically deducts the fee.

### 4. End-to-End Integration
- Every interaction via Cypher commands automatically triggers billing across all phases (training, evaluation, final exam).
- Internal Agentic KG contracts are verified to forward fees to the admin wallet, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to our patent-pending AI paradigm.
