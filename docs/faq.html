            },
            {
              question: "How does the knowledge graph work?",
              answer: "SafeAI's knowledge graphs are structured representations of information that enable agents to understand relationships between entities. They are built using semantic triples (subject-predicate-object) and can be populated from various data sources. Agents query these graphs to gain context for their decision-making processes, ensuring they operate with accurate and relevant information."
            },
            {
              question: "What programming languages are supported for agent development?",
              answer: "The primary development languages supported are Python, JavaScript, and Julia. For specialized use cases, we also provide libraries for Rust, Go, and Java. Our platform uses a language-agnostic protocol for agent communication, so you can integrate with most programming languages through our API."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I deploy my agents to production?",
              answer: "Deploying agents to production involves several steps: testing in a sandbox environment, configuring security parameters, setting up monitoring, and then using our deployment tools to provision the necessary resources. We provide both a user-friendly interface and CLI tools for deployment, as well as integration with CI/CD pipelines."

          questions: [
            {
              question: "How does SafeAI ensure agent safety?",
              answer: "SafeAI employs multiple safety mechanisms: value alignment through explicit ethical guidelines, behavior monitoring to detect anomalies, containment strategies to limit potential harm, intervention protocols for human oversight, and continuous evaluation against safety benchmarks. Additionally, all agents operate within the constraints of their knowledge graphs, which helps prevent hallucinations and false information."
            },
            {
              question: "What security measures does SafeAI implement?",
              answer: "Our security architecture includes end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, secure authentication (including Web3 wallet integration), audit logging of all system activities, regular security assessments, and compliance with industry standards. Enterprise deployments also include additional security features like VPC isolation and dedicated infrastructure."
            },
            {
              question: "Can agents access sensitive data?",
              answer: "Agents can be granted access to sensitive data, but this access is strictly controlled through permission frameworks. Data can be encrypted at rest and in transit, and access is governed by policy-based controls. Sensitive operations can require multi-factor authentication or approval workflows for additional security."
            },
            {
              question: "How are agent decisions audited?",
              answer: "Every agent decision is recorded with its reasoning process, knowledge graph queries, and confidence levels. This audit trail allows you to understand why an agent took specific actions and verify its decision-making process. The audit logs are tamper-evident and can be exported for compliance purposes or further analysis."

          questions: [
            {
              question: "What can SafeAI agents do?",
              answer: "SafeAI agents can perform a wide range of tasks including data analysis, content generation, decision support, process automation, research assistance, and more. Their capabilities are determined by their access to knowledge graphs, tools, and permissions. Agents can work autonomously or collaboratively with humans and other agents."
            },
            {
              question: "Can agents learn from their experiences?",
              answer: "Yes, agents can learn in several ways: through explicit feedback from users, by updating their knowledge graphs based on new information, and by refining their decision models based on outcomes. This learning is always constrained by safety guardrails to prevent unwanted behavior drift."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I create custom agents?",
              answer: "Custom agents can be created using our Agent Workshop tool, which provides both visual and code-based development options. You can define an agent's goals, knowledge access, tools, permissions, and interaction patterns. Agents can be developed from scratch or by customizing existing templates for common use cases."
            },
            {
              question: "Can agents work together?",
              answer: "Yes, SafeAI supports multi-agent systems where agents can collaborate to solve complex problems. You can define communication protocols, task delegation rules, and coordination mechanisms. This enables the creation of specialized agent teams that combine different capabilities and knowledge domains."
            },
            {
              question: "What limitations do agents have?",
              answer: "While powerful, SafeAI agents do have limitations. They are constrained by their knowledge graphs and don't have general internet access unless specifically permitted. They require clear goal definitions and may struggle with highly creative or nuanced human values. Their capabilities are also limited by computational resources and the quality of their underlying models."
