## Overview

The SafeAI Platform uses blockchain technology for three main purposes:
1. **Billing and Access Control**: Pay-per-use model for accessing AI capabilities
2. **Audit Trail**: Immutable record of all system actions
3. **Governance**: Decentralized decision-making for system updates

### Key Benefits
- Transparent pricing
- Verifiable usage
- Immutable audit logs
- Decentralized governance
- Automated billing

## Smart Contract System

### SafeAIBilling Contract

The core smart contract (`SafeAIBilling.sol`) manages all billing operations:

```solidity
contract SafeAIBilling {
    address public owner;
    uint public feeWei;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // More implementation details in contracts/SafeAIBilling.sol
}
```

### Key Functions

1. **Deposit Funds**
   ```solidity
   function deposit() external payable
   ```
   - Users deposit ETH to their balance
   - No minimum deposit required
   - Funds are immediately available

2. **Query Charging**
   ```solidity
   function chargeForQuery(address user) external returns (bool)
   ```
   - Automatically deducts fee for each query
   - Fails if insufficient balance
   - Returns true on success

### For Non-Technical Users

Think of the smart contract as a prepaid card system:
1. You deposit funds (like loading a prepaid card)
2. Each query automatically deducts a small fee
3. You can check your balance anytime
4. You can add more funds whenever needed

## Token Economics

### Fee Structure

1. **Basic Queries**
   - 0.0001 tokens per simple query
   - Examples: math problems, simple puzzles

2. **Complex Operations**
   - 0.001 tokens per complex query
   - Examples: ethical validations, multi-step transformations

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Volume discounts available
   - Contact system administrators for custom pricing

### For Non-Technical Users

- Fees are automatically calculated
- System warns you when balance is low
- Automatic top-up options available
- Monthly usage reports provided

## User Wallets

### Setting Up Your Wallet

1. **New Users**
   - Download MetaMask or similar Ethereum wallet
   - Create a new account
   - Save your recovery phrase securely

2. **Existing Wallet Users**
   - Connect your wallet to the platform
   - Approve the connection request
   - Ready to use!

### For Non-Technical Users

Think of your wallet as a digital bank account:
- It stores your funds
- You need it to pay for services
- Keep your password and recovery phrase safe
- Never share private keys

## Transaction Monitoring

### Viewing Your Transactions

1. **Through Platform Interface**
   - Login to dashboard
   - Click "Transaction History"
   - Filter by date/type

2. **Through Blockchain Explorer**
   - Use Etherscan or similar
   - Enter your wallet address
   - View all transactions

### For Non-Technical Users

- All charges are transparent
- Get email notifications for transactions
- Download monthly statements
- Set up spending alerts

## Integration Points

### For Developers

1. **Web3 Integration**
   ```javascript
   const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
   const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
   ```

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**
   ```javascript
   // Deposit funds
   await contract.methods.deposit().send({
     from: userAddress,
     value: depositAmount
   });
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy smart contract
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   ```yaml
   blockchain:
     network: mainnet
     contract: 0x...
     minBalance: 0.01
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Audited by independent firms
   - Open source code
   - Bug bounty program

2. **Transaction Security**
   - Multi-signature requirements for large transactions
   - Rate limiting
   - Fraud detection

3. **User Security**
   - 2FA required for large transactions
   - IP whitelisting available
   - Activity monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Transaction Failed**
   - Check balance
   - Verify gas price
   - Network congestion

2. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Reset MetaMask
   - Check network settings
