![Agent Workshop Interface](../images/agent-workshop-interface.svg)

## Introduction

The SafeAI Agent Workshop is a powerful visual interface for creating, configuring, and managing intelligent agents within the Agentic Knowledge Graph ecosystem. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of the Agent Workshop, with step-by-step instructions suitable for users new to the SafeAI platform.

## What Are Agentic Knowledge Graphs?

Before diving into the Agent Workshop, it's helpful to understand what Agentic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are:

An Agentic Knowledge Graph is a specialized graph database that:
- Stores structured knowledge about a specific domain
- Defines relationships between different concepts
- Provides reasoning capabilities through AI agents
- Ensures ethical and secure use of information

SafeAI agents leverage these knowledge graphs to perform complex tasks while maintaining security, transparency, and ethical compliance.

## Accessing the Agent Workshop

To access the Agent Workshop:

1. Log in to the SafeAI Management Console
2. Connect your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the upper right corner
3. From the main navigation sidebar, click on "Agent Workshop"

## Agent Workshop Interface Overview

Click "Next" when you're satisfied with the test results.

### Step 6: Deploy Your Agent

The Deployment Controls allow you to make your agent available for use:

1. **Environment** - Select where to deploy (Development, Staging, Production)
2. **Scaling** - Configure auto-scaling settings
3. **Monitoring** - Set up performance and health monitoring
4. **Notifications** - Configure alert notifications
5. **Backup Strategy** - Set automated backup preferences
6. **Blockchain Configuration** - Configure licensing and transaction settings

Click "Deploy" to complete the process.

## Agent Management

Once you've created agents, you can manage them through the Agent Browser:

The Agent Browser provides:
- List of all your agents with status indicators
- Search and filter functions
- Quick actions for common operations
- Detailed performance metrics
- Version history and rollback options

### Common Management Tasks

#### Editing an Existing Agent

1. Find the agent in the Agent Browser
2. Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon)
3. Make your changes in the Agent Editor
4. Click "Save" to update the agent

#### Duplicating an Agent

1. Find the agent in the Agent Browser
2. Click the "Duplicate" button (copy icon)
3. Provide a new name for the duplicate
4. Click "Create" to make a copy

#### Monitoring Agent Performance

1. Find the agent in the Agent Browser
2. Click the "Metrics" button (chart icon)
3. View performance data in the metrics dashboard
4. Set alerts for performance thresholds

## Advanced Features

### Natural Language Agent Creation

For users who prefer a more conversational approach, SafeAI supports creating agents using natural language descriptions:

1. Click "Create with Description" in the Agent Workshop
2. Enter a detailed description of what you want the agent to do
3. The system will generate a complete agent configuration
4. Review and adjust the generated configuration
5. Proceed with testing and deployment

Example description:
```
Create an agent that analyzes financial transaction data to detect fraudulent patterns. It should check for unusual transaction amounts, frequencies, and locations. The agent should flag suspicious transactions for review and generate detailed reports. It needs access to the financial knowledge graph and should operate with high security and privacy standards.
```
