3. Understand the [Data Flow](data-flow.md)
      
      
### For Developers
1. Read the [Blockchain Integration](blockchain-integration.md)
2. Review the [Knowledge Graph Architecture](knowledge-graph-architecture.md)
3. Check the [Infrastructure Guide](cloud-architecture.md)
      
      
### For DevOps
1. Study the [Deployment Architecture](deployment-architecture.md)
2. Review the [Networking Guide](networking.md)
3. Understand the [Monitoring Setup](monitoring.md)
      
      
## Architecture Standards
      
      
### Design Principles
- Scalability

- Encryption
- Compliance
      
      
## Diagrams
      
      
### System Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Service Layer]
    C --> D[Data Layer]
    D --> E[Blockchain]
    D --> F[Knowledge Graph]
```
      
      
### Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API
    participant K as Knowledge Graph
    participant B as Blockchain
    
    C->>A: Request
    A->>K: Query
    K-->>A: Response
    A->>B: Transaction
    B-->>A: Confirmation
    A-->>C: Result
```
      
      
## Best Practices
      
      
### Design Patterns
- Microservices
- Event-Driven
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
      
      
### Performance
- Caching
- Load Balancing
- Database Optimization
- Query Optimization
      
      
### Security
- Defense in Depth
- Least Privilege
- Zero Trust
- Compliance
