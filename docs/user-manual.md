// Relationship query
MATCH (a:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(b:Person) 
RETURN a, r, b;

// Creating nodes
CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 30}) 
RETURN n;

// Creating relationships
MATCH (a:Person), (b:Person) 
WHERE a.name = 'Alice' AND b.name = 'Bob' 
CREATE (a)-[r:KNOWS {since: 2010}]->(b) 
RETURN a, r, b;
