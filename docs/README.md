## Serving Documentation Locally

To properly view the interactive demos and documentation (especially if you see a blank screen when opening from disk), it is recommended to serve the docs folder with a local web server. You can use one of the following methods:

### Unix/Linux/MacOS
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `docs` directory.
2. (Optional) If `serve_docs.sh` is not executable, run the following command to set the execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x serve_docs.sh
   ```
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ./serve_docs.sh
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/interactive-demos/index.html`.

### Windows
1. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the `docs` directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bat
   serve_docs.bat
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/interactive-demos/index.html`.

## Docker-Based Deployment

SafeAI now supports a streamlined Docker-based deployment approach that sets up all components automatically. This includes the SafeAI GUI, documentation server, and Neo4j database with the SafeAI plugin.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git for cloning the repository

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FortressAI/safeAI.git
   cd safeAI/safeAI-gui
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   # For Unix/Linux/MacOS:
   ./deploy.sh

   # For Windows:
   deploy.bat
   ```

This will automatically:
- Build and start all required containers
- Set up the Neo4j database with the SafeAI plugin
- Start the documentation server
- Configure all necessary networking

### Access Points
After deployment, you can access the following services:
- SafeAI GUI: http://localhost:3001
- Documentation: http://localhost:8080
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
- Neo4j Bolt: bolt://localhost:7687

### Manual Container Management
If you need to manage containers manually, you can use the following commands:
```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Restart a specific service
docker compose restart [service-name]
```

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the container logs using `docker compose logs`
2. Ensure all required ports are available
3. Verify Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed
4. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](support/troubleshooting.md) for common issues
