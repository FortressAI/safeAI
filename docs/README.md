# SafeAI Platform Documentation

## Platform Overview

The SafeAI Platform is a Neo4j-based Knowledge Graph system that enables the development, deployment, and management of Agentic Knowledge Graphs (AKGs). The platform provides:

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Neo4j graph database for storing knowledge and agent relationships
   - Cypher query language for all interactions
   - Blockchain integration for transaction verification and audit trails

2. **Key Features**
   - Agent node creation and management
   - Secure relationship definitions
   - Resource monitoring and limits
   - Blockchain-verified transactions
   - Audit logging and compliance

3. **Development Focus**
   - All interactions are through Cypher queries
   - No built-in UI/application layer
   - Designed for integration into custom solutions
