## System Architecture

The Math KG uses a multi-agent system for proof construction:

```json
{
  "proof_system": {
    "core_agents": {
      "AdvancedProofAgent": {
        "purpose": "Construct rigorous proofs using induction and contradiction",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.93
      },
      "GeometryProofAgent": {
        "purpose": "Generate geometric proofs using Euclidean principles",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.92
      },
      "NumberTheoryAgent": {
        "purpose": "Handle number theory proofs",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.90
      }
    },
    "support_agents": {
      "AlgebraicSimplification": "Simplify expressions",
      "CalculusDifferentiation": "Handle calculus steps",
      "CalculusIntegration": "Manage integration",
      "MatrixOperations": "Handle linear algebra"
    }
  }
}
```

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Prerequisites

```python
def setup_proof_environment():
    requirements = {
        "platform_version": ">=1.0",
        "wallet_setup": True,  # For blockchain verification
        "api_access": {
            "endpoints": {
                "training": "https://example.com/math_data/training",
                "evaluation": "https://example.com/math_data/evaluation",
                "final": "https://example.com/math_data/finalExam"
            }
        }
    }
    return requirements
```

### 2. Configuration

```python
def configure_proof_system():
    config = {
        "max_agent_chain": 3,  # Maximum number of agents in sequence
        "min_confidence": 0.90,  # Minimum confidence threshold
        "verification_steps": True,  # Enable step-by-step verification
        "blockchain_validation": True  # Enable blockchain validation
    }
    return config
```

## Proof Construction Process

### 1. Proof Planning

```python
def plan_proof(theorem):
    steps = {
        "1_analyze": "Break down theorem into components",
        "2_strategy": "Choose proof method (direct/indirect/induction)",
        "3_prerequisites": "Identify required lemmas and theorems",
        "4_structure": "Plan proof structure and steps",
        "5_validation": "Set up validation criteria"
    }
    return steps
```

### 2. Agent Selection

The system automatically selects appropriate agents based on the proof type:

```json
{
  "proof_types": {
    "geometric": ["GeometryProofAgent", "AlgebraicSimplification"],
    "number_theory": ["NumberTheoryAgent", "AdvancedProofAgent"],
    "analysis": ["CalculusDifferentiation", "CalculusIntegration", "AdvancedProofAgent"],
    "algebraic": ["AlgebraicSimplification", "AdvancedProofAgent"]
  }
}
```

## Agent Composition

The DynamicCompositeMathAgent orchestrates proof construction by:

1. Analyzing the proof requirements
2. Selecting appropriate agent combinations
3. Sequencing proof steps
4. Validating intermediate results

```python
def compose_proof_agents(theorem):
    composition = {
        "analysis_phase": {
            "agent": "AdvancedProofAgent",
            "task": "Determine proof strategy"
        },
        "construction_phase": {
            "primary_agent": "Selected based on proof type",
            "support_agents": "Based on required operations"
        },
        "verification_phase": {
            "agent": "DynamicCompositeMathAgent",
            "task": "Validate proof completeness"
        }
    }
    return composition
```

## Validation and Verification

### 1. Proof Validation

```python
def validate_proof(proof):
    criteria = {
        "logical_soundness": check_logic(proof),
        "completeness": verify_steps(proof),
        "clarity": assess_clarity(proof),
        "rigor": verify_rigor(proof)
    }
    return all(criteria.values())
```

### 2. Blockchain Verification

Each proof step is recorded on the blockchain for:
- Immutability
- Auditability
- Peer verification
- Credit attribution

## Examples

### 1. Number Theory Proof

Example of proving a number theory theorem:

```python
# Example: Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational
proof_setup = {
    "theorem": "sqrt(2) is irrational",
    "method": "contradiction",
    "agents": ["NumberTheoryAgent", "AdvancedProofAgent"],
    "steps": [
        "Assume sqrt(2) is rational",
        "Express as fraction in lowest terms",
        "Square both sides",
        "Derive contradiction",
        "Conclude irrationality"
    ]
}
```

### 2. Geometric Proof

Example of a geometric theorem proof:

```python
# Example: Prove the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°
proof_setup = {
    "theorem": "Triangle angle sum is 180°",
    "method": "direct",
    "agents": ["GeometryProofAgent"],
    "steps": [
        "Construct parallel line",
        "Identify corresponding angles",
        "Apply parallel line properties",
        "Sum angles"
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Proof Structure**
   - Start with clear theorem statement
   - Break complex proofs into lemmas
   - Use appropriate level of detail
   - Include all necessary steps

2. **Validation**
   - Verify each step independently
   - Check for logical gaps
   - Ensure clear reasoning
   - Validate prerequisites

3. **Documentation**
   - Document assumptions
   - Explain key insights
   - Reference theorems used
   - Include visualizations when helpful

4. **Common Pitfalls**
   - Skipping steps
   - Unclear reasoning
   - Insufficient justification
   - Missing edge cases
