<a id="querying-knowledge"></a>
## 5. Querying Knowledge

### Basic Queries

Use the Query Builder to create simple queries:

1. **Find Nodes**: Select node types and optional properties
2. **Follow Relationships**: Explore connected nodes
3. **Filter Results**: Add conditions to narrow results
4. **Return Properties**: Specify which data to display
5. **Sort and Limit**: Order results and control result count

### Cypher Query Language

For advanced interactions, use Cypher in the query panel:

```cypher
// Find all concepts related to "Artificial Intelligence"
MATCH (concept:Concept)-[r]-(related)
WHERE concept.name = "Artificial Intelligence"
RETURN concept, r, related
LIMIT 50
```

### Common Query Patterns

1. **Entity Lookup**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (entity:Entity {name: "Specific Name"})
   RETURN entity
   ```

2. **Relationship Exploration**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (start:Node {name: "Start Node"})-[r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(end)
   RETURN start, r, end
   ```

3. **Path Finding**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH path = shortestPath((start:Node {name: "Start"})-[*]-(end:Node {name: "End"}))
   RETURN path
   ```

4. **Property Aggregation**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (n:Node)-[:HAS_PROPERTY]->(p:Property)
   RETURN n.name, count(p) as property_count
   ORDER BY property_count DESC
   LIMIT 10
   ```

5. **Pattern Recognition**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (a)-[:CONNECTS_TO]->(b)-[:CONNECTS_TO]->(c)-[:CONNECTS_TO]->(a)
   WHERE a.id < b.id AND b.id < c.id
   RETURN a, b, c
   ```

### Saving and Loading Queries

2. **Query Templates**: Create parameterized queries for reuse
3. **Query History**: Access recently run queries
4. **Export/Import**: Share queries with others
5. **Query Collections**: Organize queries into themed collections

## 8. Integration with Agents

### Agent Access to Knowledge Graphs

AI agents can interact with knowledge graphs for:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Access facts and relationships
2. **Reasoning**: Draw inferences based on graph patterns
3. **Decision Support**: Use graph data to inform choices
4. **Learning**: Update graph based on new information
5. **Explanation**: Trace reasoning paths through the graph

### Configuring Agent-KG Interactions

In the Agent Workshop:

1. Select which knowledge graphs an agent can access
2. Define access permissions (read-only, write, admin)
3. Set query depth and breadth limits
4. Configure caching and performance settings
5. Establish update protocols for agent-driven changes

### Knowledge Graph Queries from Agents

Agents can query knowledge graphs via:

1. **Direct Cypher**: Execute precise graph queries
2. **Natural Language**: Convert questions to graph queries
3. **Pattern Matching**: Find specific structural patterns
4. **Semantic Search**: Locate conceptually similar content
5. **Inference Rules**: Apply logical rules to derive new information

<a id="best-practices"></a>
## 9. Best Practices

### Knowledge Graph Design

1. **Consistent Modeling**: Use consistent patterns for similar data
2. **Appropriate Granularity**: Balance detail vs. manageability
3. **Clear Relationships**: Define precise relationship types
4. **Property Organization**: Store data on appropriate elements
5. **Maintainable Structure**: Design for future growth and changes

### Query Optimization

1. **Index Key Properties**: Ensure frequently queried properties are indexed
2. **Limit Result Size**: Use LIMIT to constrain large result sets
3. **Specific Patterns**: Be as specific as possible in pattern matching
4. **Parameterize Queries**: Use parameters instead of string concatenation
5. **Profile Queries**: Use PROFILE to identify performance bottlenecks

### Visualization Best Practices

1. **Focus on Relevance**: Show only what matters for the current task
2. **Consistent Visual Language**: Use consistent styling for node types
3. **Contextual Information**: Provide details on demand
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple and allow drilling down
5. **Appropriate Layouts**: Choose layouts that highlight important patterns

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Query Performance Problems

**Issue**: Queries are slow or time out  
**Solution**:
1. Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried properties
2. Limit result sets with LIMIT clause
3. Use more specific patterns to narrow the search space
4. Check for cartesian products in your query
5. Consider using PROFILE to identify bottlenecks

#### Visualization Rendering Issues

**Issue**: Graph visualization is slow or crashes  
**Solution**:
1. Reduce the number of visible nodes and relationships
2. Use filtering to show only essential elements
3. Switch to a simpler layout algorithm
4. Disable animations and advanced visual features
5. Try a different browser or update your current one

#### Data Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Graph data appears incorrect or inconsistent  
**Solution**:
1. Check for duplicate nodes with slight variations
2. Verify that relationship directions are correct
3. Ensure properties use consistent formatting and types
4. Look for orphaned nodes without proper connections
5. Run consistency validation queries

#### Access and Permission Problems

**Issue**: Unable to access or modify graph data  
**Solution**:
1. Verify you're connected with the correct wallet
2. Check your permission level for the specific graph
3. Ensure you're not in read-only view mode
4. Verify network connectivity to the graph database
5. Contact an administrator if permissions need adjustment
