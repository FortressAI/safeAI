## Examples and Use Cases

### Real-World Scenarios
1. **Resource Optimization**
   ```python
   # Example of resource optimization configuration
   resource_optimization = {
       "energy": {
           "target_reduction": 0.2,  # 20% reduction
           "monitoring_interval": "1h",
           "alerts": {
               "threshold": 0.8,  # 80% of target
               "actions": ["notify", "optimize"]
           }
       },
       "water": {
           "target_reduction": 0.15,  # 15% reduction
           "monitoring_interval": "1d",
           "alerts": {
               "threshold": 0.8,
               "actions": ["notify", "optimize"]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Carbon Footprint Tracking**
   ```python
   # Example of carbon footprint tracking
   def track_carbon_footprint(activity):
       # Calculate emissions
       emissions = calculate_emissions(activity)
       
       # Update tracking
       update_emissions_log(emissions)
       
       # Check against targets
       if exceeds_target(emissions):
           notify_team(emissions)
           optimize_process(activity)
       
       # Generate report
       generate_report(emissions)
   ```

### Implementation Examples
1. **Energy Management**
   ```python
   # Example of energy management system
   energy_manager = {
       "monitoring": {
           "metrics": [
               "power_usage",
               "efficiency",
               "peak_load",
               "renewable_ratio"

           }
       },
       "optimization": {

               "load_balancing",
               "peak_shaving",
               "demand_response"
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Waste Management**
   ```python
   # Example of waste management system
   def manage_waste(waste_type, amount):
       # Categorize waste
       category = categorize_waste(waste_type)
       
       # Track waste
       log_waste(category, amount)
       
       # Optimize disposal
       if is_recyclable(category):
           route_to_recycling(amount)
       else:
           route_to_disposal(amount)
       
       # Update metrics
       update_waste_metrics(category, amount)
   ```
