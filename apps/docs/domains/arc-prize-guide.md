## 3. Understanding ARC Puzzles

### Puzzle Structure

Each ARC puzzle consists of:

1. **Training Examples**: A set of input-output pairs demonstrating a pattern
2. **Test Examples**: Input grids for which the agent must predict the output

### Grid Format

ARC puzzles use colored grid representations:

1. Grids are 2D arrays of integer values (0-9)
2. Each integer represents a different color
3. Grid dimensions vary between puzzles (typically 1x1 to 30x30)
4. The UI renders these integers as colored cells for visual clarity

### Key Concepts

1. **Abstraction**: Identifying patterns that generalize beyond specific examples
2. **Reasoning**: Applying logical transformations based on identified patterns
3. **Transfer Learning**: Using knowledge from one puzzle to solve others
4. **Core Knowledge**: Leveraging innate concepts like object permanence, counting, and spatial relationships
