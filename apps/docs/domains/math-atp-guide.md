## 2. Getting Started

### Accessing Math ATP

1. Log in to the SafeAI Management Console
2. Connect your wallet
3. From the main navigation sidebar, click on "Math ATP"

### Understanding Formal Languages

Math ATP supports several formal languages for theorem representation:

1. **First-Order Logic (FOL)**: The most common format, supporting predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives
2. **Higher-Order Logic (HOL)**: Extends FOL with quantification over functions and predicates
3. **Set Theory**: Based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC)
4. **Type Theory**: Supporting dependent types and constructive mathematics

### Key Concepts

1. **Theorem**: A mathematical statement to be proven
2. **Axiom**: A basic statement accepted without proof
3. **Proof**: A sequence of logical steps from axioms to the theorem
4. **Inference Rule**: A pattern of logical reasoning
5. **ATP Agent**: An AI agent specialized in automated theorem proving

<a id="creating-theorems"></a>
## 3. Creating Theorems

### Basic Theorem Creation

1. Navigate to the Theorem Editor tab
2. Enter a name for your theorem
3. Select the formal language (default: First-Order Logic)
4. Type the theorem statement in the editor
5. Click "Validate" to check syntax and well-formedness

### Syntax Examples

#### First-Order Logic

```
// Universal quantification
forall x (P(x) -> Q(x))

// Existential quantification
exists x (P(x) & Q(x))

// Implication
P -> Q

// Conjunction
P & Q

// Disjunction
P | Q

// Negation
~P
```

#### Set Theory

```
// Set membership
x ∈ A

// Subset relation
A ⊆ B

// Set operations
A ∪ B
A ∩ B
A \ B
```
