# SafeAI Plugin Microagent Development Guidelines

## 1. Comprehensive Overview

### Architecture Overview
- **Core Modules:**
  - **Crypto:** Handles encryption and secure signing.
  - **Aggregation:** Aggregates outputs and data from various transformation agents.
  - **Blockchain:** Records transactions (transformations, licensing events, governance votes) with immutable audit trails and ensures dynamic token-based licensing.
  - **Licensing:** Manages cost transparency and token-based licensing.
  - **Usage:** Tracks usage metrics and performance.
  - **Governance:** Facilitates decentralized decision-making for updating ethical standards and agent configurations.
  - **Authentication:** Provides secure access control.
  - **Learning Module:** Includes PuzzleSolver and ConversationalAgent for dynamic learning from training data.

- **Foundational Knowledge Graphs (KGs):**
  - **Ethics KG:** Built automatically at startup. Contains nodes for EthicalConcepts, MoralDilemmas, LogicalFallacies, Arguments, and candidate Solutions. Serves as the benchmark for ethical validation.
  - **ARC Puzzle KG:** Demonstrates how abstract puzzles (e.g., ARC puzzles) are processed and transformed.

- **Dynamic Transformation Agents:**
  - Agent definitions, including metadata and executable code (in Java/Groovy scripts), are stored in the KG.
  - Transformation agents are dynamically loaded at runtime using the Java Scripting API (or Groovy), allowing their logic to be updated without redeployment.
  - Performance metrics and historical data of agents are maintained in the KG to continuously refine and generate new agents.

- **Blockchain Integration:**
  - Every transformation, licensing event, and governance vote is digitally signed, hashed, and recorded on a blockchain sidechain.
  - This ensures transparent, immutable audit trails and supports real-time, dynamic token-based licensing.

## 2. Guide to the Development Process

### Writing and Refining Transformation Agent Code
- **Storage & Structure:**
  - Store agent definitions in the KG with a unique identifier, name, description, and executable code snippet.
  - Include performance metrics and historical data to inform further refinements.

- **Dynamic Loading:**
  - Use the Java Scripting API (or Groovy) to retrieve, compile, and execute the agent code dynamically at runtime.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Write modular, well-commented code for each transformation agent.
  - Validate agent output against predefined test cases before deployment.
  - Update performance data in the KG regularly for continuous improvement.

### Contributing New Transformation Logic
1. Write your transformation code using the provided templates.
2. Store your agent's metadata and code in the KG.
3. Run local unit tests to validate functionality.
4. Use our decentralized governance process to submit and review changes.

### Running Unit Tests and Deployment
- **Unit Testing:**
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- **Deploying to Neo4j:**
  - Update `plugin-config.properties` with your Neo4j connection details.
  - Deploy the plugin using the provided deployment scripts.
- **Interactive Demo:**
  - Launch the user guide demo:
    ```bash
    java -cp target/safeAI-plugin.jar com.safeai.neo4jplugin.UserInteractionDemo
    ```
  - Follow the on-screen instructions to initialize KGs, load transformation agents dynamically, and observe blockchain audit trails.

## 3. Enhancing the Developer Experience

### Interactive Menu Configuration
- When interacting with the microagent environment, developers will be guided through:
  - **Initializing KGs:** Overview of how the foundational Ethics KG and ARC Puzzle KG are built automatically at startup.
  - **Dynamic Agent Generation:** Step-by-step instructions for retrieving and updating agent configurations from the KG.
  - **Blockchain Audit Trails:** How transactions are logged, and how the dynamic token-based licensing model operates.
  - Example queries and use cases are provided, illustrating how an SME might publish an ethically validated KG and how end users access these KGs with transparent cost breakdowns.

## 4. Documentation Integration

- This document is integrated into the repository to provide quick access to development guidelines and configuration details.
- It is a living documentâ€”please update it with new best practices or changes to the system architecture.
- The interactive guide in the microagent configuration will reference this document for instant help.
